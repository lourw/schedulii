### Setup Steps

2. `cargo c` to ensure you have all required rust dependencies
3. `cargo install sqlx-cli` we use sqlx for compile time validation of sql queries

#### Schedulii UI

1. Run a local development server for the frontend using `npx nx serve schedulii-ui`

#### Schedulii API

The entire project utilizes Nx to support the development of each app. Review each app and lib's `project.json` to see which commands are available to run.
